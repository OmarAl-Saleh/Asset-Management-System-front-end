## üîê Authentication

On successful login, JWT access and refresh tokens are saved in localStorage.

Tokens are decoded to extract roles.

Access to components is protected using route guards:

AuthGuard: blocks unauthenticated access

AdminGuard: allows Admin-only access

üß™ Test Users

Username	Password	Role
```
omar	    test1234	Admin
moyyad	  test1234	User
```
