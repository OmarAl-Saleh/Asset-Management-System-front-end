## üîê Authentication
```text
On successful login, JWT access and refresh tokens are saved in localStorage.

Tokens are decoded to extract roles.

Access to components is protected using route guards:

AuthGuard: blocks unauthenticated access

AdminGuard: allows Admin-only access

üß™ Test Users
Username	Password	Role
omar	    test1234	Admin
moyyad	  test1234	User
```

## üß† Role-Based Routing Example

All routes use Angular Standalone Components

Route protection via:

AuthGuard ‚Üí Checks for valid token

AdminGuard ‚Üí Checks if role is Admin (from JWT)

Example usage in routes:

ts
Copy
Edit
{
  path: 'users',
  component: UserComponent,
  canActivate: [AuthGuard, AdminGuard]
}
